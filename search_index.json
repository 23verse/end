Methods: We reinforce the evolving concept of endometriosis as a systemic disease, in light of genomic evidence/prioritisation leveraging genome-wide associations in disease, regulatory genomics in disease-relevant cell types, states and tissues, and the knowledge of gene interactions. Done so through adapting our recently established genetics-led target prioritisation approach (Pi) applied to summary data from genome-wide association studies in endometriosis (for example, the most recent), which generated a ranked list of &gt;14,000 prioritised targets. Findings: Target genes at the leading prioritisation reveal cellular basis and molecular hallmarks that are consistent with systemic disease manifestations. Pathway crosstalk-based attack analysis identifies the critical gene AKT1, and in the context of this gene, further identifies genes (including ESR1) that are already targeted by licensed medications in other diseases (see Pathway crosstalk). Cross-disease prioritisation map enables identification of shared and distinct targets between endometriosis and autoimmune diseases (see Cross-disease comparisons). Shared target genes support repurposing opportunities of immunomodulatory drugs (see Cluster C6), while endometriosis-specific genes suggest therapeutic potentials of targeting neutrophil degranulation (see Cluster C5). Conclusion: Our results, together with target prioritisation atlas made available at https://23verse.github.io/end, may be of translational use for better treatments in patients with endometriosis.

(A) Pathway crosstalk identified by integrating target prioritisation information with knowledge of gene interactions. Nodes are labelled by gene symbols together with priority rank. Cross-talk genes that are currently targeted by approved drugs in other disease indications are highlighted in red. These ap-proved drug target genes (y-axis) and disease indications (x-axis) are detailed beneath, with dots indexed in number and referenced on the right panel showing information on drugs and mechanisms of action. (B) Effect of node removals on the crosstalk. Top: the single-node effect maximised by removing ATK1, the maximum effect of removing an additional approved drug target in the context of AKT1, and the maximum effect of removing an addi-tional approved drug target in the context of AKT1 and ESR1. Bottom: node removals are indicated by colored circles.
